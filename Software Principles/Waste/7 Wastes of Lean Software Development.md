1. Partially done work - unfinished work ideas.
2. Overproduction - preemptively writing code based on a prediction, but it doesn't get used.
3. Relearning - Tied with context switching. You move from one feature to another before finishing, than have to come back to the feature. You forget knowledge during this switch. 
4. Handoffs - Moving work to someone else. One person who has the knowledge hands off the work to someone who doesn't. 
5. Context Switching - Jumping between multiple features at once. 
6. Delays - Delays from management or customers, adapting to changing requirements.
7. Bugs - You'll spend more time fixing bugs than actually writing the code.
