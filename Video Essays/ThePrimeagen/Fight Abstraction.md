Right code so you have context on one screen. When you have too many little functions, it can be really difficult to figure out what's going on.

Clean code is a myth. What is readable changes based on time of day, how much sleep you've gotten, what kind of mood you're in. There are just varying degrees of bad code and what people think is good is entirely subjective.
